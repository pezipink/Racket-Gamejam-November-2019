# Racket-Gamejam-November-2019

This project was written over a couple of evenings for the Racket Novemeber Gamejam.

It is an implementation of the classic robotfindskitten "Zen Simulator" and is written in my Racket-based 6502 assembler, asi64 https://docs.racket-lang.org/asi64/index.html

The code can be found here https://github.com/pezipink/Racket-Gamejam-November-2019

The music is awesome, be sure to check it out!
